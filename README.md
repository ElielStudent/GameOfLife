# GameOfLife
A simple implementation of the famous cellular automata "Conways's Game Of Life" written in c++ using SFML.

### Controls
Spacebar toggles whether the game updates the cells automatically or not.
Backspace repopulates the screen with a 50% chance of a cell being alive.
Any other keyboard key updates the game by one step.
Clicking on a cell will toggle it from dead to alive and viceversa.
